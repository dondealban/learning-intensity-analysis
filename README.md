# Learning the Intensity Analysis framework

This is a repository set up as my personal exercise for learning the Intensity Analysis framework [(Aldwaik & Pontius 2012)](#aldwaik_pontius_2012), an approach that unifies the measurements of size and stationarity of land changes at three levels: interval, category, and transition, using the `intensity.analysis` R package implementation [(Pontius & Khallaghi 2019)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/intensity.analysis/index.html). It can also be used as a tutorial for someone interested in learning structural topic modeling for their research projects.
